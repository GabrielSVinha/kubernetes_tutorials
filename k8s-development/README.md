# Setting up the kubernetes development environment

This tutorial will consider that you are using Linux as OS, github as version control system and bash as shell.

## Installing go 

For this tutorial, I am using GO version `1.8.3` and I have used `$HOME/.programs/go` path as the place where I will install go files 

First you need download golang binaries

```bash
$ wget https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.8.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

After finish the download, you should extract the go file to the path which you chose

```bash
$ 
```


## Creating(forking) your kubernetes repository

1. Visit [https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes)
2. Click Fork button (top right) to establish a cloud-based fork.
